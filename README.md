Dry Maize Price Forecasting in Kenya
Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning–based time series forecasting solution to predict average weekly dry maize prices in selected counties in Kenya. The forecasts are designed to support agriBORA’s integrated storage, credit, and market intelligence platform, helping farmers make informed decisions on when to sell their produce, maximize earnings, and manage post-harvest risks.

The solution uses historical market price data, robust feature engineering, and a tuned LightGBM regression model to generate rolling two-week-ahead forecasts over a six-week horizon.
